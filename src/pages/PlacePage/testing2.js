The fried perch Benedict was so good and I don’t normally care for cooked fish. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and helped us make our selections. *Great brunch spot,",

My husband had the fish and chips, which was a hit. He typically never eats the slaw that is served with a dish like this, but he said this slaw was the best he’s ever had. I had the roasted chicken and it was so tender and flavorful. We will definitely come back and will recommend The Dearborn to family and friends who are in the area.",

I was able to check my luggage up front before heading to the bar. The bartenders were very nice and attentive. I was shocked how big the burger was and didn’t expect it to be a double patty. My food was amazing and the pricing was good. Will definitely be back",

Sat on the patio and it was a beautiful day. The waiter (name I forgot & forgot to get receipt. He had curly brown hair and service was phenomenal). He made sure we got the chance to look at the menu more, answered our questions, check in on us during the food, and was just so helpful! I am definitely coming back here. The food was so deliciosos and I honestly this espresso martini was better than any other places I’ve had so far!",
