Being attentive, the staff understood the situation and provided more help than usually expected in the situation.  This restaurant is in a convenient location, on a bus line, and filled with good food and people.  I would highly recommend coming to this establishment and meet the great folks inside.",

The home fries tasted like they were old and reheated. I will say the service was wonderful, which is why I gave it three stars instead of two.",
